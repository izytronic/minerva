Minerva is an easy to use intrusion and hazard alart detection system. 

## Motivation
I started with minerva cause I'm interested in electronics, 3D-printing and realizing new projects. So I design the cases for the sensors, write the firmware for the sensors and the software for the mainframe. 

The system will be remote-controlled and -of course- easy to use and install. Later I want to add some home-control functions like heating, power control etc.

## Roadmap
**Initial version**
The first version should contain: movement and temperature detecting, arm/disarm using RFID chips, notification via SMS

**Step 2**
Android app for receiving notifications and be able to arm/disarm the system remotely

**Step 3**
Adding more sensors and home-control using a standard wireless protocol
